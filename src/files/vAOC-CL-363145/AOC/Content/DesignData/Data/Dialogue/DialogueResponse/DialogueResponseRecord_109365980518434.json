When I set out this morning I had an appointment to interview Krelzenus Vagesh, the renowned Vek alchemist and inventor. He had been in Verra for some time, having come through the Divine Gateway at least six weeks earlier. I hoped to pick his prodigious brain regarding any discoveries, oddities, or inspirations that had surfaced since his arrival. I met Vagesh at a local market, a bazaar of sorts set up in the vacant meadow in which the settlement was located. The merchants had an odd assortment of items for sale -- mostly dead things, a few living things, and a number of crude implements designed to turn live things into dead things.\")",
