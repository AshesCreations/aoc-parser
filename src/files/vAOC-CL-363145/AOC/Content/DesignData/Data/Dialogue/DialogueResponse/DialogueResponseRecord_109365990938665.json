She had an odd voice, halfway between a purr and a hiss.?Hejo?? I asked Vagesh.  ?Yes,? he replied. ?In what passes for a Tulnar language, it means ?hello.\\'? It made sense, I thought. The Tulnar language was a crude, invented sort of pigeon-creole, cobbled together with words from a variety of sources. The greeting ?Hejo? was most likely a combination of the common-language word ?hello? and the Orcish greeting ?vajo,? which literally translates as ?no harm.? I  gave Kish my own ?Hejo,? and she responded with a smile and a slight wuffle of a laugh. I took this for an expression of approval. \")",
