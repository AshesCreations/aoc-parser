Without any instructions she\\'s been able to whip up quite an array of potions, poultices, and powders. She learned simply by watching me.\\\" How clever!? I said, leaning forward to get a better look at the equipment on the table. Without thinking, my fingers reached for one of the candlesticks. \\\"No touch!\\\" Kish warned, and one of her appendages.  I couldn\\'t be sure if it was a hand or a paw -- slapped my hand away.  I recoiled instantly, but the slap was gentle, and her paw-hand-what-have-you was small, perhaps half the size of my own. It was also padded, and partially covered with fur. If she had claws or talons, they were retracted so as not to harm me.\")",
