I can\\'t say conclusively, but I\\'ve seen others from her familial clan eat spoiled meat and wild mushrooms without issue. If it\\'s not common to the entire species, we can at least be certain it runs in her family.\\\"\\\"You talk too much!\\\" Kish suddenly hissed, narrowing her eyes at me. \\\"You go now! Can\\'t make chemical magic with all this talking!\\\" \\\"Our sincere apologies, Kish,\\\" said Vagesh. He motioned for me to go ahead, then followed me through the tent flap. \\\"It\\'s good practice to keep her happy,\\\" he continued. \\\"She can throw quite the tantrum when she\\'s frustrated or tired. But I\\'m thrilled with her progress. She went from tidying up and cleaning glassware to performing her own experiments in days. I\\'d hate to lose her over something trivial.\\\"\")",
