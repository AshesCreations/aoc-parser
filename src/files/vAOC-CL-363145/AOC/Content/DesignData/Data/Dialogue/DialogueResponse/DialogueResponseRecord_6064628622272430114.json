Careful not to make any sudden movements that might give away my presence, I shifted my gaze and saw a fully-grown stag emerging from the brush on the opposite bank, a short distance downriver. As it lowered its head to drink from the creek, I resisted the urge to look directly at it, fearing it might flee. Instead, I focused on its reflection, stretched and wobbling on the wind-rippled surface of the water. As the breeze subsided, the ripples stilled, and the woodland creature\\'s reflection came into sharp focus.\")",
