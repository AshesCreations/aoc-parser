She held the device up, facing the direction in which the mist-kirin had retreated. Its rotation immediately slowed, then stopped, and she fell to her knees with a frustrated sigh.\\\"Months wasted,\\\" she grumbled. \\\"Now I\\'ll have to start all over again.\\\" She tugged open a leather satchel at her hip and carefully packed the device into it. Looking up at me with undisguised disappointment, I thought I might have seen a tear in her eye. I fell silent, awkward with guilt, unable to think of a thing to say. I was sorry for having startled her prey, but something else was bothering me. While I\\'d never seen a living kirin, I had read about them many times, and I didn\\'t recall anything about them having the ability to intentionally wield Essence.\\\"I understand,\\\" she said, sensing my confusion. \\\"You had no way of knowing.\\\" She drew in a long breath and exhaled heavily, relieving much of the tension in her posture.\")",
