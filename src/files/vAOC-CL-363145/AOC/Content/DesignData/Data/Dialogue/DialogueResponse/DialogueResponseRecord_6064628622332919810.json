Among the first of its kind. It\\'s older than the apocalypse. My people call it a Bodabodaga. It\\'s one of the most powerful beings in this wood.\\\" She noticed the skeptical raise of my eyebrow and chuckled. \\\"No, it\\'s true! Though I suppose you wouldn\\'t suspect that from a creature so easily frightened.\\\" I found this fascinating and made a mental note to research this Bodabodaga further. \\\"Thing is,\\\" she continued, \\\"you can\\'t just hunt a Bodabodaga. Its greatest survival mechanism is its ability to polymorph into raw Essence. It dissolves into mist. You saw it. Once it transforms, forcing it to return to its original form requires a very precise, very complex ritual. I have no talent for spellcasting, so I\\'ll have to wait until it reverts on its own. And it won\\'t do that with mortals in the vicinity, so I\\'ll need to start all over again. I\\'m afraid I\\'m back to square one.\\\"\")",
