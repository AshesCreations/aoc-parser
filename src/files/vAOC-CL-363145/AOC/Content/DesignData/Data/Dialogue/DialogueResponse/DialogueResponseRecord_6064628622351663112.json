Hey, relax!\\\" I said. \\\"I\\'d never try to.\\\" But she wasn\\'t listening. \\\"Don\\'t even think of trying to follow me, elf!\\\" \\\"I\\'m half-elven, actually,\\\" I said, smiling warmly in an attempt to calm her fears. Suddenly filled with mistrust, the hunter backed away from me as she drew her bow and nocked an arrow. \\\"The Bodabodaga is not for you!\\\" she shouted. \\\"Hands off! And don\\'t try to follow me, neither!\\\" She continued to back away, picking up speed until she melted into the shadows of the forest and vanished as quickly as she\\'d appeared.\")",
