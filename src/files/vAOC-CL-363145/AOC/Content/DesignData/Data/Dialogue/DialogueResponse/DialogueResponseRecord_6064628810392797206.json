Fattened by the souls of the wee, she fell to the lullaby, and then came the sgian-dubh. Slumbering ever more, the priestess was punctured, unable to screech or run. Out came a rush like a bagpipe undone, thus was the release of the souls of wee ones. Back to the village the piper did run, playing a newfound lullaby of wee ones. \\\"Where are our children? You promised us before!\\\" the adults clamored and crowed. \\\"They sing aloud in this lullaby of slumber. Play them at night to rest the wee and ward off evil!\\\" With this, the piper did go over hill and beyond moor in the dead of night, faded lullaby in tow. Yet beware, children and adults of ages anew; the priestess may soon wake, creaking and hungry, looking for you.\")",
