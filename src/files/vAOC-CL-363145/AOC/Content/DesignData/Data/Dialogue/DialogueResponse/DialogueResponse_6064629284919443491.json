He was a loving and just father, grandfather and beacon of might. He served in the Kaelar Army for over 30 decades and repelled chaos during the Sanctus Riots. He was also instrumental in turning the tides of the Siege of Solitude. His fire shall burn bright with essence as it passes on into the unknown.
