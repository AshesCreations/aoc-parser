I have reason to believe that the Prime Healer is up to something nefarious. I have seen her personally ride into Gravepeak at the dead of night. I had to follow her, thinking she may have need of a healer\\'s hand and knowledge. I rode with a caravan of circus seekers that were headed to some curious carnival in Gravepeak. Veiled by cloak, I spied the Prime Healer meeting with a tall fellow of some import. She passed to him four urns then rode off in fast flight. When I queried the man, he scowled and smirked, simply saying that he would see me soon enough, but not yet. I fear for my life. Upon my death or disappearance this is my record of accusation. - Lynette Xander\")",
