There are four known arcane ley lines, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. An Essence Well will siphon residual magic to create a reservoir of arcane power.  The Essence Wells must be contructed near their elemental source. Once functioning, a well can be siphoned using an Arcane Rod, or in some cases a Foci, which allows access to all forms at once. \")",
