My magic detected it, and my kin Harl went to retrieve it. Alas, brave Harl was waylaid by cultists, the Sighted. They subdued him, stole the artifact, and cast him from the cliffside just there. If I hadn\\'t been watching Harl might have been killed! Yet I was there, and I drew him from the water myself. We fled under the Cultists\\' arrows, and I shielded my kin with my own body. Now I skulk here, tending my wounds, watching the island for a sign of those cultists. My magic says that the artifact is still there, but my tribe has found neither cult nor cursed vessel on that haunted rock - cold spirits and cold stone. What say you, godling? Will you seek out our prize?\")",
