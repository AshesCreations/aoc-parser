It was made for his funeral. He was not a demigod, but rather, a simple Dunir immigrant. His specialty was the study of time and space. According to this, he vanished with his tower from a hill near the city of Aela, leaving a magical vortex and odd floating crystal in its place. A similar fate befell his apprentice mere months before! They were never seen again.]\")",
