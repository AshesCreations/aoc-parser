	"responseText": "Closer examination reveals a pattern! These engravings form a map of the annual movements of the Ashen Flame tribe. From the gardens in the north, near Carphin, the Ashen Flame move with the seasons to an island far to the west. Thereafter they move south, to a camp not far from Lionhold, and when spring arrives, they travel to a grove near Oakenbane. Each camp shows a marker, some sort of totem, and an indication of water. All is surrounded with glyphs, carved in the strange hand of the minotaurs.",
