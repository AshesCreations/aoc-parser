You see, I sought to prove my valor to the elders by retrieving a token of power from Carphin Isle. My kin Sehmi had found, with his fledgling divinations, a vessel - fuming with cursed intent.I found the vessel, and went to retrieve it, that Sehmi might drive the corruption from it and free the magic bound within.Our design was to bring the cleansed vessel to the Streamweavers in our tribe, that they might then access that magic to consecrate our sites of power.But I was surprised by a group of the Sighted! They blinded me with curses and ran me to the ground. I lost the vessel, Sehmi was wounded dragging me from the island, and now I am shamed by my tribe.\")",
