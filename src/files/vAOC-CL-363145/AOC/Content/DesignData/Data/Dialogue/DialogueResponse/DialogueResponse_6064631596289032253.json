He is encamped near the isle, watching for those cultists, the Sighted. Though we dare not meet in the open, I know he still seeks to clear my name. Godling, hear me now. I am in great need. My kin is alone there in his camp. Still in danger because of my aspirations. Help him. Go to Sehmi and help him find those Sighted and retrieve my trophy.
