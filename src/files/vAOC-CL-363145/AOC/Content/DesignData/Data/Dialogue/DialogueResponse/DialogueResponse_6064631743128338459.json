The Guards of Carphin Tower are cruel indeed to those caught thieving from their grounds - I was cursed to serve them as a Guard myself, but of another type. When they had finished their terrible magics I was transformed, and for untold ages now I have been trapped here, left behind when all was left behind. I am alone, in these ruins, haunted by those that condemned me to this fate! Avenge me! Disperse the energies of these cruel guardsfolk, and destroy this scrap in their own eternal flame when you\\'ve finished. I fear this scrap of myself may be enough yet to regenerate my cursed form.\")",
