The Ashen Flame tribe moves throughout their range as the circle of the year progresses. In the north in the growing season, the east when the sun rides high, all around our range my kin passes with the season. You too shall make this trek.At each of our camps, I ask that you spread a bit of this ash that I have prepared. This will hide our sites from the peering eyes of the goblins\\' magicked ravens, and will cloak you from their eyes as well. When you\\'ve finished, you will know our camps, and may instruct your people on how to avoid them, until your people inevitably bring to us the terms of your surrender, and we take custodianship of this range for good.Here are the ashes, godling. Now leave.\")",
