I\\'m here to help establish a branch of our academy upon Verra, since there is so much to study here. Sadly, we\\'re currently broken down here and are awaiting supplies from Sanctus.As a historian passionate about uncovering ancient truths and preserving our past, I spend countless hours researching, always with my trusty notebook in hand. While I began my studies on Sanctus, I\\'m eager to see what we can uncover about our past here.There\\'s something about old books that keeps me inspired, and when I\\'m not buried in archives, I dabble in brewing potions from rare herbs. So, what can I help you with today?\")",
