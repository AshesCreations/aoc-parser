We believe rediscovering ancient arcane technologies and harnessing the Essence can grant immense power. The scholars of the past left a wealth of knowledge, and reconnecting with the gods could reveal their intentions and guidance. We\\'ve allied with the Court of Cloaks to procure rare items and the Striders to protect our field expeditions. However, we face opposition from the League of United Tradesfolk, who prioritize empowering common tradesmen and protecting laboring professions.\")",
