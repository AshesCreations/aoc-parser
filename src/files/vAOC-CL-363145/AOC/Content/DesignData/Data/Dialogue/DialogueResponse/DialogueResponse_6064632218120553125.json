If you consider their recent actions, the Forsaken Blade are far beyond redemption. His addled mind, his well-being, his collusion with cultists, his irreverence toward the Gods... this soldier has fallen far from Aldric\\'s favor. May the divine hammer strike down at any moment. Commander Avenmoor will want to review this new information herself, and perhaps send you a personal commendation. You\\'re an honorable ally after all, and when the time comes we hope to call on you to fight alongside us.\")",
