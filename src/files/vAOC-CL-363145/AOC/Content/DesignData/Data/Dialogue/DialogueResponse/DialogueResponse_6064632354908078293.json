I am sure to join you in the coming months. Please stay safe. I know that is difficult when you are a footman in the army. Mother and Father send their love. Father also wanted me to mention that you not delve to deep into the family heirloom you took with you. He said he has been researching it after a professor from the Academy came to see him. They had long talks into the night. From what I gather, that little silver ball is more than it appears. But I am sure you know this already. Much love, my brother. I shall see you soon. Sincerely, Kirstia Spencer\")",
