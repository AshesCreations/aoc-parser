	"responseText": "So, you may have noticed how many people have been coming to Verra recently. It's a lot. We Striders pride ourselves on keeping the roadways safe for merchants and travelers - and sometimes that's as simple as keeping a weather eye for lost belongings on the roadways. It's traumatic enough to move homes, let alone to someplace so strange and new! I'll admit that it feels pretty good to give a stuffie back to a kid that dropped it along the road, or a chest of heirlooms thought washed down a creek in a crossing! To that end, the Striders Vigilant have been taking up a collection in each of the fledgling settlements out in the Riverlands. Then we get together with some of our friends in the Greyshore transporters and they make sure everything finds it's way to the rightful owner. It's a lot of work, though. There are a lot of lost things. Care to lend a hand on your way to - wherever you were going?",
