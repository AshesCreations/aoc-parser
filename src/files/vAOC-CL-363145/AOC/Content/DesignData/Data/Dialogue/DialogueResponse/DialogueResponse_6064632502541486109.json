Our people often used stelae to memorialize important events that occurred in those specific locations.  The trail up to the mesa is treacherous and Amir will not spare any mercenaries to assist my research.  I need you to use these supplies and take rubbings of the entire stela.  Bring them back to me and we will be able to decipher what has transpired here and why our ancestors felt it so important to remember.\")",
