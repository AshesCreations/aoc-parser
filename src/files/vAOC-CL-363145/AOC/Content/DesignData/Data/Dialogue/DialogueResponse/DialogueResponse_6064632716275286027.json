Scattered about the pile are deep spear and axe marks gouged into the terrain. Near the caravan debris a sigil belonging to the League of United Tradesfolk lays motionless, its meaning now lost in death. This wasn\\'t a bandit attack; nothing of value was taken but lots of goods were smashed and scattered about in the fracas. The lack of looting hints that this caravan and its merchant were intentionally waylaid. Tracks and scattered debris lead northward over the hill.\")",
