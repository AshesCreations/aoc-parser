The merchant caravans on the road to Halcyon, they are no simple traders. They are part of their plan, part of the poison they bring. Trade is their tool, to soften us, make us weak. I say no. We will not bend. We will show them.The caravans must not reach Halcyon. Do what must be done, destroy their goods, scatter them. Let them feel the Ashen Flame\\'s fury. We are bound to Burnmoot, not to the soft words of the Exalted. Let them know we still hold our power, and we will never kneel. This is not a raid. It is a message. Show them that we hold to the old ways, and if they think they can take that from us, they will find only fire and blood. -Zinjala\")",
