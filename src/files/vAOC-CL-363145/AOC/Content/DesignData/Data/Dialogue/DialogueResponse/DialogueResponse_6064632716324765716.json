The trade here is growing, though I\\'m finding more risks than I expected. I\\'ve been dealing with the Minotaur, selling what I can. Dangerous, yes, but it\\'s necessary. I know it\\'s not the safest, but it\\'s how we\\'ll make it. They\\'re hungry for arms, and the deals have been profitable. What\\'s odd is that there\\'s talk of someone in Halcyon working to ease the trade for people like me. I don\\'t know who they are yet, but it could make things smoother. I\\'ve heard rumors that this could mean fewer dangers on the road, so I\\'m keeping my ear to the ground. But with every trade, the roads grow more perilous. I see more signs of tension, more eyes on me. I\\'m trying not to worry about it, but the thought of not coming back to you or the child? That\\'s a burden I carry. Keep praying to the Seven for me. I\\'ll make sure I return to you, and we\\'ll start a new life here. The life we\\'ve dreamed of. Yours always, Galen\")",
