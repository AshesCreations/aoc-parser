The real Horn is with me in Skohapa. I will use it in the binding ritual to call the Helot spirits, and prove to the High Chieftain, the Elders, and all of Verra that the Great Herd rises again.Let Halcyon and their traders think they can buy peace. When the spirits walk, they will see that our strength is not for sale. The old ways will protect us, and I will show them that I alone lead. The ritual must succeed. The Horn is the key.\")",
