Some cling to war, while I seek peace, trade, and future without battle. We, Smolderhoof Path, walk new road, but not all follow. Our people divided. Many fear peace weaken us, but I know it is our strength. This journey hard, but it is only way forward. I move with resolve, but it is lonely path. The land call for peace, and spirits show future beyond war, but old ways hard to cast aside. Path is hard, but we press on. Our future in balance, not in blood.\")",
