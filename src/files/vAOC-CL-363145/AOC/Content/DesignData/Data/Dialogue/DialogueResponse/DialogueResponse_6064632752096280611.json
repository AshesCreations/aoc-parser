The flute, worn by time, not touched by me, but it sings old songs. Wiyakoni's trust, it reaches through these gifts, wrapped in the stillness of the spirit. He seeks to mend what's broken, but the path is not clear. What lies beyond is veiled, and what's lost may not fully return. But if you walk this path, child of the winds, be prepared to listen to the silence, for it will guide you.\")",
