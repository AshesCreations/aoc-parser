Seek the mushroom, where the undead roam, near the Church of the Seven Stars. It grows on their bodies, fed by their lingering whispers. Eastward, in the shadow of the Sullied Tower, the black silk of the Ebonthread Recluse awaits. And find the Solvanna root, where daffodils and earth meet, their growth entwined. Bring these to me, and I will weave them into an elixir, its glow holding the spirits\\' dance.\")",
