Fame he does not desire, nor power, but his bond with spirit world is deep, unbroken. He will know the path to purify the Horn, to cleanse its curse. T'kano's ways are hard, yet they are honest. He will aid you, but only if you approach with respect and clear purpose. Bring freshly cut flax as an offering, and take the bone flute I provide. It will show your heart, help him to see your intent.\")",
