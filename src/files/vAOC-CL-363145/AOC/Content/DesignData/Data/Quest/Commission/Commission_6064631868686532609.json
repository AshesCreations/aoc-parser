While many among the Halcyon Guards remain loyal to the Kaelar crown, a growing number have deserted their training. While majority opinion may dismiss the rebellion\\'s beliefs to be alarming and unjustified, too many have fallen under their persuasion. The investigation continues in Gravepeak, where the Forsaken Blade are raiding tombs for supplies. Travel to Gravepeak to restore any damage done to the memories of Aelan ancestors, and punish the criminals who stray further and further from the Exalted path. The Forsaken Blade who abandon the Kaelar Flag are also abandoning the sacred past of their people by desecrating the graves of Xander. Despite their vandalism, it may still be possible to recover lost history by restoring the damage done to the gravesite.\")",
