There are signs they are unsatisfied by the alliance with their weaker bandit counterparts, and their ambitions may be larger than the loyalists ever expected. If they seek the power of the Sighted, will the cultists be persuaded to support the rebellion against the Kaelar Army? Such a terrifying alliance might still be prevented and the civilians of Halcyon saved from doom if disharmony stands in the way of two factions working together. It\\'s up to the people of Halcyon to find ways to shake doubt into the potential alliance forged between the Sighted and the Forsaken Blade. The mistrust between them must grow before the Kaelar can take any further action toward besieging the citadel.\")",
