As suspected, the Forsaken Blade have been stockpiling more than just weapons. The supplies headed for Halcyon have been cut off altogether. The seized Kaelar caravans have been destroyed and their cargo transported to the old stronghold. To make matters worse, all signs point toward an alliance with the Sighted, the dark worshippers on a cryptic mission. Halcyon trembles with fear as it becomes surrounded on all sides by their enemies and their enemies\\' powerful friends, all of whom wish that they meet their bitter end. Whatever schemes have been concocted by the Forsaken Blade are bound to be cruel and twisted beyond the imagination of their former selves. As the Kaelar Army prepare to assault the citadel, it would be wise for Commander Eudoxia to gather as much reconnaissance as possible on what\\'s ahead.\")",
