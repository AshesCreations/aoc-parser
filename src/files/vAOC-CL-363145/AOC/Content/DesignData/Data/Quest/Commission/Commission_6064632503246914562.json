In the shadowy corners of Baneswood Cemetery, a figure of dread has emerged: Baron Baneswood, who was once a noble man, now walks the night as a Grim Reaper. This ominous presence appears only under the cover of night, claiming the souls of the unwary who dare to wander his domain. His spectral form instills terror among the townsfolk, and many have vanished without a trace. We implore you to confront this grim specter and bring peace to our restless nights. Your bravery will be deeply valued, and we will offer our humble thanks for your efforts. Oh! You most certainly should bring others with you.\\\" -Alaric Wyndemere\")",
