As the strongest and most talented trailblazer among them, Sweeney \\\"the Dealer\\\" is a born fighter. With dagger in one hand, and sword in the other, she slices through New Aela charters like no one has seen before. They say it\\'s the lucky gold hoop earring they wear, and the others hope that luck never runs out. Since they split ways at their previous camp, the team retraces their steps to where this whole mess began. According to Dwayne, they had assigned their duties over the outcome of a game of cards. As the loser that day, Sweeney is reported to be holding onto their funding for safekeeping. But since they\\'ve been missing, the others fear that they might have made the worst decision yet. Sweeney may have run off, or worse still, they may be in grave danger.\")",
