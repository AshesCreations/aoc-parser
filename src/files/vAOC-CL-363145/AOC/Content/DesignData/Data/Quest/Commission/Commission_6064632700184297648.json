They direct their anger at the Exalted descendants who disturb their stomping grounds. The early settlers make an attempt to retrieve as many of the precious artifacts, documents, and treasure as possible, but many have no choice but to retreat. One such scholar, a displaced mage, pointed me toward his home, the Honorsworn Tower, where he had been quietly studying from its ancient libraries. That is until recently, when he became rudely evicted by haunts. While some argue over the law of property in the afterlife, others seize what\\'s theirs by right of force. Perhaps if more manifests are recovered from the tower, Emiguel the Bookkeeper will make good use of them. Besides, he will have to hear the bad news concerning Sweeney\\'s disappearance and he might not take it so lightly. Unless, of course, the manifests are replaced. The concern remains, however, the deceased return from their graves and prevent newcomers from trespassing upon their ancient cellars.\")",
