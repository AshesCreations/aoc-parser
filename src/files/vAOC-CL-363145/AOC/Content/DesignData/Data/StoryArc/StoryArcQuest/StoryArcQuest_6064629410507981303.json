The description matches one of the Lowlands Abbey, sacrilegious clerics who keep ferocious wolves among them as companions. He may have been followed by one of the Stonecutters after he had refused to modify the lettering on one of the branches of the Heritage of Households. He urges you to find out more from the Letterist and interrogate the Lowlanders about the lost nephew of the Radiant, Sir Renslee. If the cleric speaks the truth, this information might be valuable to some high ranking officials.\")",
